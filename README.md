Requires mongodb installed and running, install with `npm install`, run with `npm start`. Note that the install phase frequently fails on Windows, I think due to some of mongodb's dependencies not respecting certain Windows filesystem concurrency restrictions that don't exist on Linux/Mac. Untested on anything except Windows.
